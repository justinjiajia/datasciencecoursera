###Explanation for run_analysis.R

- The code first loads the features and activity labels for test data, and subsets the features for mean and standard deviation measurements by using the `grepl()` function.
- It then treats the training data in a similar fashion.
- It combines the two data sets into one data frame by using the `rbind()` function.
- It reshapes the data frame by using the `melt()` method so that each row corresponds to only one variable measured in a fixed time interval.
- It uses the `dcast()` function to create the tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity type and each subject.

###Description of the tidy data
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix ¡®t¡¯ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. and the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) ¨C both using a low pass Butterworth filter.

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the ¡®f¡¯ to indicate frequency domain signals).
 
####Description of abbreviations of measurements

leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
Body = related to body movement.
Gravity = acceleration of gravity
Acc = accelerometer measurement
Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
Mag = magnitude of movement
mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.

####The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

####The list of variables in the tidy data set is given below:
